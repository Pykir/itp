## FtoC

####Process:

I started by figuring out what the project needs were. To start with, there would be two variables, a calculation, and finally a display to show the final result. 

Defining the variables was very simple, and I chose to seperate the bindings and calculations to make the code more readable, although this was probably much less efficient. 

####Further improvements:

After finishing the project to the standards of the assignment, I decided I might as well make it a functional calculator. I did this by creating a prompt asking the user for the temperature in fahrenheit, and sending that to the f variable. There is no edge case catching, so if the user inputs anything other than a number the program returns NaN.
