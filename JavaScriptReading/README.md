## JavaScript Reading

#### Chapter 1: "Values, Types, and Operators"

One thing I knew was the way integers are stored in binary, although it did take me a second to search up that javascript only has a number type, and stores them all as floating point numbers.
One thing I did not know was the fact that emojis take up two character positions. This makes some behavior that I have seen in lightweight text applications make alot of sense, where emojis would not function even when copy pasted in from another source. These applications most likely did not contain the full unicode standard OR used ASCII/UTF-8.

#### Chapter 2: "Program Structure"
One thing I knew was the way loops work, since it appears to be basically the same as java.
One thing that was new to me was the let statement. I had never seen a catchall defining expression like this before.

#### Chapter 3: "Functions"
One thing I knew was the general concept of functions and control flow.
One thing I did not know was that there were so many ways to define a function in javascript. It was quite surprising!
