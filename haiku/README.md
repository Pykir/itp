I first found my haiku, which ended up in me going down a rabbit hole on what is even considered a haiku nowdays - surprisingly complicated. I found a fascinating haiku journal based in New Zealand called Kokako and in it's 40th edition was this haiku:

```
     overflow
   hands cupped
under the waterfall

Owen Bullock, Kokako 40
```

I then navigated to this folder and recorded the computer reciting the poem through the CLI. I added a comma after overflow because it felt right to have a pause between overflow and the rest of the haiku.
